## ABSTRACT

The transfer of water from the Pao river to the lake Valencia basin has caused a severe environmental impact, with serious economic and social consequences, due to the increase in the lake's elevation. This study has created a model of historical and spatial evolution to estimate the variation of lake surface and volume from 1976 to 2019. Bathymetric data and a digital elevation model of 30 m resolution were integrated to create a continuous topographic model of the lake bottom and the surrounding surface. The area covered by the lake in 1976, 1986, 1990, 2000, 2014, and 2019 was determined based on the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), calculated from the green and medium infrared bands of LANDSAT images of those dates. The area and volume of the lake for each considered date were estimated from the generated model. The analysis was performed with QGIS-GRASS and ArcGIS Pro, for comparison purposes, and similar results were obtained. The lake expanded from 324 to 405 km2, and its volume increased from 6664.77 MCM to 17514.14 MCM between 1976 and 2019. The average height of the lake estimated by the model was 6 meters lower than the level of the lake, measured in the year 2000, and 3.5 meters higher than the level measured in 2017. The estimates of the model must be adjusted with field data, to be used as a basis for decision making. However, this cannot be realized in the short term because the official lake level data come from a single measurement point.

Keywords: Lake Tacarigua, MNDWI, multitemporal analysis, bathymetry, hypsometry.
